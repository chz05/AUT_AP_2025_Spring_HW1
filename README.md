# **First Question: File Organizer Script**

## **Objective**

Develop a bash script that automatically organizes files in a specified directory by sorting them into subdirectories based on their file extensions. This exercise will strengthen your understanding of file system manipulation, loops, conditional logic, and logging within bash scripts.

## **Script Requirements**

- **Shebang Line:** Start your script with `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Input Validation:**  
  - **Required Parameter:** The path to the target directory.
  - Display an error message and exit if the directory does not exist or if the parameter is missing.

- **File Organization Process:**
  - **Iteration:** Traverse all directories and subdirectories in the provided directory.
  - **Extension-Based Sorting:**  
    - For each file, determine its extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`).
    - Create a subdirectory for that extension if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
    - Move the file into the corresponding subdirectory.
  - **Optional Flags:**  
    - Include a `--dry-run` option that simulates the organization process without moving any files. This allows users to preview actions before applying changes. (This option is optional for the script but mandatory to implemented.)
    - For each file processed, the script should print a message detailing the action it would take. For example:  
     ```plaintext
     [DRY-RUN] Would move 'example.txt' to '<TARGET_DIR>/txt/example.txt'
     ```

- **Logging:**
  - Generate a log file (e.g., `organizer_log.txt`) in the target directory.
  - Log key details for each file moved: original location, destination subdirectory, file name, and timestamp.
  - Ensure the log format is clear and structured.
  - **Format of the log file is up to you, (Surprise Me ðŸ˜Ž)**

## **Example Usage**

```bash
./organize_files.sh <TARGET_DIR>
```

*With dry-run mode:*

```bash
./organize_files.sh <TARGET_DIR> --dry-run
```

### **Second Question: Sorting Points by Euclidean Distance**

**Objective:**  
Implement a function that takes a vector of 3D points (each represented as a `std::array<int, 3>`) and sorts the vector **in-place** based on the Euclidean distance of each point from the origin (0, 0, 0).

**Function Prototype:**

```cpp
void sort_points_by_distance(std::vector<std::array<double, 3>>& points);
```

**Task Details:**

- **Euclidean Distance Calculation:**  
  For each point `(x, y, z)`, the Euclidean distance from the origin is given by:
  \[
  \text{distance} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
  \]
  *Note:* Since you are only comparing distances, you can compare the squared values (`x*x + y*y + z*z`) to avoid computing the square root.

- **In-Place Sorting:**  
  The function must sort the input vector directly without using additional containers to store a copy of the data.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Assume the input vector is valid. If it is empty, the function should simply return without performing any operations.

- **Example:**  
  Given the input:
  ```cpp
  std::vector<std::array<int, 3>> points = { { {3, 4, 0} }, { {1, 1, 1} }, { {0, 0, 5} } };
  ```
  After sorting, the vector should have points ordered from the closest to the farthest from the origin.

### **Third Question: Counting Islands in a 2D Grid**

**Objective:**  
Implement a function that takes a 2D grid (a `std::vector<std::vector<int>>`) where `1` represents land and `0` represents water, and returns the number of distinct "islands" in the grid. An island is defined as a group of horizontally or vertically adjacent `1`s surrounded by `0`s.

**Function Prototype:**

```cpp
int count_islands(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid);
```

**Task Details:**

- **Island Definition:**  
  An island is a collection of one or more adjacent `1`s. Cells are considered adjacent if they are horizontally or vertically next to each other. Diagonal connections should **not** be counted.

- **Algorithm Hint:**  
  You can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the grid and mark cells that belong to the same island.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - If the grid is empty, the function should return `0`.
  - If there are no `1`s in the grid, the function should return `0`.

- **Example:**  
  For the grid:
  ```cpp
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> grid = {
      {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
      {1, 1, 0, 0, 1},
      {0, 0, 1, 0, 1},
      {0, 0, 0, 1, 1}
  };
  ```
  The function should return `3` because there are three separate islands in the grid.

## **Final Step: How To Test Your Program**

If you want to debug your code, set the `if` statement to `true`. This will allow you to place your debugging code in the designated section. Once you're done with the debugging process, remember to set the `if` statement back to `false` to test your program using the provided `unit-test.cpp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (true) // Set to false to run unit-tests
    {
        // Debug section: Place your debugging code here
    }
    else
    {
        ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
        std::cout << "RUNNING TESTS ..." << std::endl;
        int ret{RUN_ALL_TESTS()};
        if (!ret)
            std::cout << "<<<SUCCESS>>>" << std::endl;
        else
            std::cout << "FAILED" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
